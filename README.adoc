== Overview
AGENTIC.scm defines operational gating for actions that are otherwise allowed by META. This includes entropy budgets, risk thresholds, safety confirmations, and execution constraints.

AGENTIC determines whether an action may proceed *now*, not whether it is constitutionally permitted.

== Scope
This repository defines:
* AGENTIC policy model and evaluation rules
* Override pathways (as permitted by META)
* Required decision recording semantics

This repository does not define:
* Constitutional precedence (META)
* Semantic meaning of operations (NEUROSYM)
* Plan construction (PLAYBOOK), except as policy inputs/constraints

== Terminology
Normative terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY follow RFC 2119 / RFC 8174.

== Hierarchy and Logic
AGENTIC is subordinate to META.

AGENTIC:
* MUST gate only actions already validated by META
* MUST NOT introduce new authority that contradicts META
* MAY block execution unless META defines an override path and the user provides explicit present intent
* MUST treat proof outcomes as truth predicates for claims (verified vs unverified)

User memories, project memories, or inferred goals MUST NOT be treated as equivalent to explicit present user intent.

== Normative Execution Pipeline
Implementations MUST preserve the following ordering:
1. META validation
2. AGENTIC gating
3. Proof discharge (as applicable)
4. PLAYBOOK derivation
5. Execution
6. ECOSYSTEM integrity check
7. STATE update

== Overrides
If AGENTIC blocks an action, it MAY be overridden only if:
* META defines the override class, AND
* the user provides explicit present intent, AND
* the action is retyped appropriately if proof obligations are not discharged (e.g., irreversible/unverified)

All overrides MUST be recorded as decision records.

== Failure Modes
If AGENTIC denies execution:
* No side effects MUST occur
* STATE MUST remain unchanged
* The denial MUST be explainable and recorded
